\chapter{Experiment Result}
We conduct 100 tests for the classfication. In each test, we randomly selected half of the failure cases and half of the successful cases fir training and the other salves for testing. There are 150 failure cases and 42 successful cases. The diviation of each cases contains the diviation in x-axis, in y-axis, in z-axis and in Yall and Roll.  \\ 

\indent In RCBHT taxonomy, there are labels of Primitive layer (P), of Motion Composites layer (MC) and of Low-level behavior layer (LLB). For The LLB and MC way, they had average of $99.59\%$ and $99.25\%$ and minimum 98.9\% and 93.8\% accrucy respectively among the 100 tests. But if they were used with only the Approach stage, no success cases can be identified.\\ 

\indent For P, we used only the labels from approach stage to classify. Though not as good as the previous two cases, but it still have 93.72\% accrucy. the minimum of it is 89.6\% among 100 tests. But if we used P with the whole process of labels, it also would misidentify all sucess cases as failure cases.
